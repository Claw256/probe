# CORE FEATURES

Probe delivers powerful code search capabilities designed for modern development workflows.

## CODE UNDERSTANDING

Probe doesn't just search text—it understands code:

- **FULL CODE BLOCKS**: Gets entire functions, classes, or structs—not just lines
- **AST PARSING**: Uses Abstract Syntax Trees to understand code structure
- **SEMANTIC SEARCH**: Finds code by concept, not just exact text matching
- **LANGUAGE AWARENESS**: Recognizes code patterns specific to each language

## RAW PERFORMANCE

Built for serious speed with large codebases:

- **RIPGREP ENGINE**: Lightning-fast initial text scanning
- **OPTIMIZED PARSING**: Efficient tree-sitter integration
- **SMART CACHING**: Remembers parsed structures between searches
- **MULTI-CORE**: Utilizes all available processing power

## RANKING THAT WORKS

Sophisticated algorithms that put the right code on top:

- **TF-IDF**: Weighs terms based on frequency and importance
- **BM25**: Better relevance with document length normalization
- **HYBRID RANKING**: Multiple signals combined for superior results
- **PRECISION SCORING**: Considers term position and importance

## DEVELOPER-CENTRIC DESIGN

Built by developers, for developers:

- **COMMAND LINE FIRST**: Powerful CLI that's easy to integrate
- **PIPE SUPPORT**: Works with stdin/stdout for seamless chaining
- **ERROR EXTRACTION**: Pull code directly from compiler errors
- **ZERO CONFIG**: Works out-of-the-box with sensible defaults

## PRIVACY BUILT-IN

Your code stays on your machine:

- **100% LOCAL**: All processing happens offline
- **NO TELEMETRY**: Zero data collection or analytics
- **OPEN SOURCE**: Fully transparent codebase
- **YOUR CONTROL**: Only connects to AI if you choose

## MULTI-LANGUAGE SUPPORT

One tool for all your code:

- **RUST, GO, PYTHON**: First-class support for modern languages
- **JS/TS, JAVA, C++**: Comprehensive coverage of mainstream languages
- **RUBY, PHP, SWIFT, C#**: Wide language compatibility
- **MARKDOWN**: Even handles documentation

## FLEXIBLE MODES

Multiple ways to integrate with your workflow:

- **CLI MODE**: Direct command-line for search and extraction
- **MCP SERVER**: Seamless integration with AI editors
- **AI CHAT**: Talk to your codebase with built-in AI assistant
- **WEB INTERFACE**: Browser-based exploration when you need it

## AI INTEGRATION

Built for the age of AI assistants:

- **TOKEN-AWARE**: Limits results to fit AI context windows
- **STRUCTURED OUTPUT**: Returns results in AI-friendly formats
- **MCP PROTOCOL**: Standard interface for AI tool integration
- **MULTI-MODEL**: Works with Claude and GPT models

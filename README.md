# Probe

This Rust tool combines ripgrep's searching capabilities with tree-sitter's code parsing to find and extract complete code blocks (functions, classes, structs, etc.) based on search patterns. Probe can be used as both a CLI tool and an MCP server.

## Features

- Uses ripgrep as a library for fast code searches
- Leverages tree-sitter to parse code and extract complete code blocks
- Ensures full functions/structs are extracted, not just matching lines
- Supports multiple programming languages
- Can run as a CLI tool or as an MCP server

## Installation

### Quick Installation

You can install Probe with a single command:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leonidbugaev/code-search/main/install.sh | bash
```

This command downloads and executes the installation script, which automatically:

1. Detects your operating system and architecture
2. Fetches the latest release from GitHub
3. Downloads the appropriate binary for your system
4. Verifies the checksum for security
5. Installs the binary to `/usr/local/bin`

### Requirements

- **Operating Systems**: macOS, Linux, or Windows (with MSYS/Git Bash/WSL)
- **Architectures**: x86_64 (all platforms) or ARM64 (macOS only)
- **Tools**: curl, bash, and either sudo access or root privileges

### Manual Installation

You can download pre-built binaries for your platform from the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/leonidbugaev/code-search/releases) page.

1. Download the appropriate binary for your platform:
   - `probe-x86_64-linux.tar.gz` for Linux (x86_64)
   - `probe-x86_64-darwin.tar.gz` for macOS (Intel)
   - `probe-aarch64-darwin.tar.gz` for macOS (Apple Silicon)
   - `probe-x86_64-windows.zip` for Windows

2. Extract the archive:
   ```bash
   # For Linux/macOS
   tar -xzf probe-*-*.tar.gz
   
   # For Windows
   unzip probe-x86_64-windows.zip
   ```

3. Move the binary to a location in your PATH:
   ```bash
   # For Linux/macOS
   sudo mv probe /usr/local/bin/
   
   # For Windows
   # Move probe.exe to a directory in your PATH
   ```

## Releasing New Versions

This project uses GitHub Actions to automatically build and release binaries for multiple platforms.

### Creating a New Release

1. Update the version in `Cargo.toml`
2. Commit your changes
3. Create and push a new tag:
   ```bash
   git tag -a v0.1.0 -m "Release v0.1.0"
   git push origin v0.1.0
   ```
4. GitHub Actions will automatically:
   - Build binaries for Linux, macOS (Intel and Apple Silicon), and Windows
   - Create a GitHub release
   - Upload the binaries as release assets
   - Generate checksums for verification

### Release Artifacts

Each release includes:
- Linux binary (x86_64)
- macOS binaries (x86_64 and aarch64)
- Windows binary (x86_64)
- SHA256 checksums for each binary

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following directories:

- `src/` - Source code for the application
  - `language/` - Language-specific parsing modules
  - `search/` - Search implementation modules
- `tests/` - Test files and utilities
  - `mocks/` - Mock data files for testing
- `target/` - Build artifacts (generated by Cargo)
- `.github/workflows/` - GitHub Actions workflow configurations for CI/CD

## Usage

### CLI Mode

```bash
probe <SEARCH_PATTERN> [OPTIONS]
```

#### Options

- `<SEARCH_PATTERN>` - Pattern to search for (required, positional argument)
- `--paths` - Directory paths to search in (defaults to current directory)
- `--files-only` - Skip AST parsing and just output unique files
- `--ignore` - Custom patterns to ignore (in addition to .gitignore and common patterns)
- `--include-filenames`, `-n` - Include files whose names match query words
- `--reranker`, `-r` - Reranking method to use for search results (hybrid, hybrid2, bm25, tfidf)
  - `hybrid` (default) - Simple combination of TF-IDF and BM25 scores
  - `hybrid2` - Comprehensive multi-metric ranking that considers term matches, code structure, and more
  - `bm25` - BM25 ranking algorithm (better for natural language queries)
  - `tfidf` - TF-IDF ranking algorithm (better for code-specific terms)
- `--frequency`, `-s` - Use frequency-based search with stemming and stopword removal (enabled by default)
- `--exact` - Use exact matching without stemming or stopword removal (overrides frequency search)
- `--max-results` - Maximum number of results to return
- `--max-bytes` - Maximum total bytes of code content to return
- `--max-tokens` - Maximum total tokens in code content to return (for AI usage)
- `--allow-tests` - Allow test files and test code blocks in search results (disabled by default)
- `--any-term` - Match files that contain any of the search terms (by default, files must contain all terms)
- `--merge-blocks` - Merge adjacent code blocks after ranking (disabled by default)
- `--merge-threshold` - Maximum number of lines between code blocks to consider them adjacent for merging (default: 5)

#### Examples

```bash
# Search for "setTools" in the current directory (uses frequency search by default)
probe setTools

# Search for "impl" in the src directory with exact matching
probe impl --paths ./src --exact

# Search for "search" with a maximum of 5 results
probe search --max-results 5

# Search for "function" and merge adjacent code blocks
probe function --merge-blocks --merge-threshold 3
```

### MCP Server Mode

To run Probe as an MCP server:

```bash
cd mcp && npm run build && node build/index.js
```

This starts the tool as an MCP server that can be used with the Model Context Protocol. The server exposes a `search_code` tool that can be used to search for code patterns and extract complete code blocks.

#### MCP Tool: search_code

This tool should be used every time you need to search the codebase for understanding code structure, finding implementations, or identifying patterns. Queries can be any text (including multi-word phrases like "IP whitelist"), but prefer simple, focused queries for better results. Use maxResults parameter to limit the number of results when needed.

Input schema:
```json
{
  "path": "Directory path to search in",
  "query": ["Query patterns to search for"],
  "filesOnly": false,
  "ignore": ["Patterns to ignore"],
  "includeFilenames": false,
  "reranker": "hybrid",
  "frequencySearch": true,
  "exact": false,
  "maxResults": null,
  "maxBytes": null,
  "maxTokens": null,
  "allowTests": false,
  "mergeBlocks": false,
  "mergeThreshold": 5
}
```

Note: `frequencySearch` is enabled by default. If you want exact matching without stemming or stopword removal, set `exact` to `true` which will override the frequency search behavior.

The `reranker` parameter can be set to one of the following values:
- `hybrid` (default) - Simple combination of TF-IDF and BM25 scores
- `hybrid2` - Comprehensive multi-metric ranking that considers term matches, code structure, and more
- `bm25` - BM25 ranking algorithm (better for natural language queries)
- `tfidf` - TF-IDF ranking algorithm (better for code-specific terms)

Example usage with MCP client:
```rust
use std::sync::Arc;
use mcp_rust_sdk::{Client, transport::stdio::StdioTransport};
use serde_json::json;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    // Create a stdio transport to connect to the server
    let (transport, _) = StdioTransport::new();
    
    // Create and connect the client
    let client = Client::new(transport);
    
    // Call the search_code tool
    let response = client.request(
        "call_tool",
        Some(json!({
            "name": "search_code",
            "arguments": {
                "path": "./src",
                "query": ["impl", "fn"],
                "filesOnly": false,
                "exact": true  // Use exact matching instead of frequency-based search
            }
        }))
    ).await?;
    
    println!("Search results: {:?}", response);
    
    Ok(())
}
```

The server implements the ServerHandler trait from the MCP Rust SDK, providing:

1. `initialize` - Handles client connection and capabilities negotiation
2. `handle_method` - Processes method calls like list_tools, call_tool, etc.
3. `shutdown` - Handles graceful server shutdown

The server supports the following MCP methods:
- `list_tools` - Returns information about the available tools
- `call_tool` - Executes the search_code tool with the provided parameters
- `list_resources` - Returns an empty list (no resources implemented)
- `list_resource_templates` - Returns an empty list (no resource templates implemented)

## Supported Languages

Currently, the tool supports:
- Rust (.rs)
- JavaScript (.js, .jsx)
- TypeScript (.ts, .tsx)
- Python (.py)
- Go (.go)
- C (.c, .h)
- C++ (.cpp, .cc, .cxx, .hpp, .hxx)
- Java (.java)
- Ruby (.rb)
- PHP (.php)
- Markdown (.md, .markdown)

## How It Works

1. The tool scans files in the specified directory using ripgrep
2. For each match, it parses the file with tree-sitter to build an AST
3. It then finds the smallest AST node that:
   - Contains the matching line
   - Represents a complete code block (function, class, struct, etc.)
4. Finally, it extracts and displays these code blocks with file information

## Adding Support for New Languages

To add support for a new programming language:

1. Add the tree-sitter grammar as a dependency in `Cargo.toml`:
   ```toml
   [dependencies]
   tree-sitter-go = "0.20"  # Example for Go
   ```

2. Create a new file in the `src/language` directory for the language
3. Implement the `Language` trait for the new language
4. Update the language factory to support the new file extension

## Troubleshooting

- **No matches found**: Verify your search pattern and check if there are matches using the regular ripgrep tool
- **File parsing errors**: Some files may have syntax errors or use language features not supported by the tree-sitter grammar
- **Missing code blocks**: Update the language implementation to support additional node types for your language
